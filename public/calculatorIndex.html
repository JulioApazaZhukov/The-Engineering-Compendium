    <h1>Calculator index</h1>
    <h2>This calculator index is as ugly as it is incomplete. The styles are conspicuous by their absence, and at this point I'm tired and don't feel like working on this. As often happens in programming, if something works you don't touch it, and the To-Do lists are to be forgotten.</h2>
